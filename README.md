Vehicle insurance is a contract between a vehicle owner and an insurance company that provides financial protection against losses related to the vehicle. This can include coverage for damage to the vehicle itself, liability for injuries or damages to other people and their property, and protection against theft or vandalism.

This dataset is sourced from ‘Skill Circle’ & contains comprehensive information about vehicle insurance, including details on insured individuals, their vehicles, and associated claims. It offers insights into various factors such as Age, Gender, Regional code, Annual premiums, and Policy types.

The Main objectives of this project are:

I. Data Visualization: Utilize various visualization techniques to explore the distribution of key variables.

II. Feature Analysis: Examine the relationship between features and the target variable.

III. Age Distribution: Analyze the age distribution within the dataset and its impact on insurance claims.

IV. Premium Analysis: Investigate the distribution of insurance premiums and their correlation with claim frequencies.

V. Claim Frequencies: Explore factors contributing to higher claim frequencies.

VI. Gender Analysis: Investigate the role of gender in insurance claims.

VII. Vehicle Age and Claims: Examine the impact of vehicle age on the likelihood of a claim.

VIII.Claim Frequency by Vehicle Damage: Investigate the relationship between vehicle damage and claim frequencies.

This will involve steps such as loading the data, generating descriptive statistics, profiling the data, identifying outliers, and using visualization techniques.
By analyzing these variables in depth, we aim to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations that shed light on the factors affecting insurance claims.
